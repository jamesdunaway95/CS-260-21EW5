# CS-260-21EW5
Repo for my CS-260 class that I am taking this term from 05/03/2021 to 06/27/2021

Description:
Learn about data structures and algorithms used for analyzing large volumes of data. Focus on common data structure operations, including searches and sorts. 

Data structures and algorithms are essential tools for anyone entering the field of computer science. These tools consist of specific patterns that,when applied correctly, solve problems. As a professional working in the field of computer science, you mustbe aware of the various data structures and algorithms that are available, and more importantly, when to apply them. Being familiar with differentdata structure and algorithm options allows you to solve problems efficiently, because you will not have to re-create a solution repeatedly.

Course Outcomes:
  Apply appropriate data structures for effectively organizing data given the requirements and constraints of various problems.
  Implement technically sound algorithms that accurately perform required functions.
  Employ basic algorithms and common data structures in developing effective computer programs.
  Assess foundational algorithms and data structures for their use in solving processing problems.
